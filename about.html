        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Vedika K N, a 20-year-old with a passion for coding, sports and NCC. I hail from Madikeri, but I've had the opportunity to explore and live in a different place for my studies at Mangalore.<br><br>I did my schooling in St Joseph's Convent Composite Highschool, Madikeri. I completed my 12th standard in PCMC from St Aloysius PU College, Mangalore.Now, I'm currently pursuing 3rd year engineering in Computer Science at St Joseph Engineering College, Mangalore. My academic journey has provided me with a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python, C, Java, HTML and a commitment to lifelong learning.<br><br>Outside of my professional life, I'm an avid sports person. I find joy in playing basketball, football, badminton and hockey, and I'm always excited to learn new things and participate in various activities. Whether it's sports, NCC Airwing, or simply exploring new places, I love embracing new experiences.<br><br>I'm deeply motivated by Indian Airforce and want to pursue my dream in joining defence. I believe in smart work and hard work and am committed to living a life of simplicity. I strive to realise my dream and make a positive impact in my day to day life.<br><br>I'm always open to connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring new opportunities.
